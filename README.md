# pic-assembly
This is a VSCODE adaptation of [kjetilos' PIC Assembly sintax highlight for sublime](https://github.com/kjetilos/pic-sublime), made for the pic12f675.

# Features (?)
- Syntax highlight for all 35 instructions.
- Syntax highlight for pseudo mnemonics supported by MPASM and GPASM (CLRC, SKPC, TSTF, NEGF, BC, etc.).
- Support for bitwise operators (|, &, ^, ~, <<, >>, <, >).
- Simple error detection (syntax based, no language server yet).

# TODO
- Allow proper directive highlight (currently shown as errors).
- Autocompletion.
